This project is to find the relationship between the Atlanta NBA player'Positions and Salary.


The five basketball positions normally employed by organized basketball teams are the
point guard (PG)
the shooting guard (SG)
the small forward (SF)
the power forward (PF)
the center (C).

And I found out that power forward earn higher salary that the other four positions, and I was surprised that Point guard earn less salary than the shooting guard, small forward, the center and power forward.



I used to two csv file as a refrences from data.world and Kaggle.


I first extract the csv file and then i started to clean and join the data together. After cleaning, i started to filter only ATL NBA players.
Then, I sort the salary by assending order, and compare in between the five positions. 

By using mySQL, i caclulated the average salary the players make per year and grouped by positions.


After all the cleaning and filtering processs, i created a bar chart for the NBA players salary by positions.
